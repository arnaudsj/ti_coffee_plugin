# [CoffeeScript][] -> Javascript compiler plugin for Titanium Projects.

The ti_coffee_plugin simply scans your Titanium project's `Resources` folder at build time and looks for files with the `.coffee` extension. When it finds such files, it runs the CoffeeScript compiler (`coffee -c`) to produce a Javascript file of the same name.  E.g., `win.coffee` would become `win.js`.

# Setup

First, of course, you'll need the `coffee` command available on your system.  If you can't go out to a command-line/terminal and successfully execute `coffee`, then be sure to setup [CoffeeScript][] correctly.

Next, you need to tell your Titanium project to run this plugin when the Titanium build scripts build your project.

Build-time plugins for Titanium projects are invoked if the plugin is registered in the project's tiapp.xml file.  For the ti_coffee_plugin, you could do it like this:

	<!-- This is a child element of <ti:app> in tiapp.xml -->
	<plugins>
		<plugin>ti_coffee_plugin</plugin>
	</plugins>

Then put the plugin.py into the folder `plugins/ti_coffee_plugin` in your project.  Voil√†, it will be invoked automatically when you build your files.

# Sample Application

The `sample/` folder contains a very simple Titanium project.  **Important**: The sample won't work unless you copy the plugin.py down into the `sample/plugins/ti_coffee_plugin/` folder.  I didn't want to put plugin.py in two places in the source tree.
