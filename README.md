# [CoffeeScript][] -> Javascript compiler plugin for Titanium Projects.

The ti_coffee_plugin simply scans your Titanium project's `Resources` folder at build time and looks for files with the `.coffee` extension. When it finds such files, it runs the CoffeeScript compiler (`coffee -c`) to produce a Javascript file of the same name.  E.g., `win.coffee` would become `win.js`.

# Setup

## Python

Requires Python 2.6, because the `json` module is used.  Alternatively, you can use Python 2.5 as long as you also have the [`simplejson`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/) module installed.  The `hashlib` module is also used, and that appeared first in Python 2.5, I believe.

## CoffeeScript

First, of course, you'll need the `coffee` command available on your system.  If you can't go out to a command-line/terminal and successfully execute `coffee`, then be sure to setup [CoffeeScript][] correctly.

**Also**, if you're on OS X and you used Homebrew to install CoffeeScript and Node.js, GUI applications such as Titanium Developer and Titanium Studio -- which are precisely the apps that launch your Titanium project's build process and thus this plugin -- might not be able to successfully execute `coffee` because `/usr/local/bin` is not in the PATH by default for GUI apps, and changes to `~/.profile`, `/etc/paths`, etc., are not useful for GUI apps.  The easiest solution is to simply symlink `coffee` and `node` in `/usr/bin`, which is in the PATH:

    $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node
	$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/coffee /usr/bin/coffee

If you'd rather not do that, you can muck around with `~/.MacOSX/environment.plist` following [Apple's instructions](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1067/_index.html).

## This Plugin

Next, you need to tell your Titanium project to run this plugin when the Titanium build scripts build your project.

Build-time plugins for Titanium projects are invoked if the plugin is registered in the project's tiapp.xml file.  For the ti_coffee_plugin, you could do it like this:

	<!-- This is a child element of <ti:app> in tiapp.xml -->
	<plugins>
		<plugin>ti_coffee_plugin</plugin>
	</plugins>

Then put the plugin.py into the folder `plugins/ti_coffee_plugin` in your project.  Voil√†, it will be invoked automatically when you build your files.

# Sample Application

The `sample/` folder contains a very simple Titanium project.  **Important**: The sample won't work unless you copy the plugin.py down into the `sample/plugins/ti_coffee_plugin/` folder.  I didn't want to put plugin.py in two places in the source tree.
